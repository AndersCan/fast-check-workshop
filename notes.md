# My notes

What do you think of testing, why do we test?

(I test for a better understanding (and not breaking other features)

Propertybased testing makes it near mandatory to define what valid and invalid inputs are. Not just the _types_, but also the values. For example: a number vs a number between 0 < x < 101

_Can_ remove the need for mock data

To be used together with unit tests.

At the end of this workshop you will understand how PBT can can find edge cases and how it can help you understand your code better.
